Diplomacy: The Board Game.
Implemented by Gregory Gzik

Diplomacy is perhaps one of my favourite board games of all time. It is set just before the period of WWI, and the player is one of the great powers set to gain control of Europe.
The central feature to this board game - often setting it apart from war board games of similar style - is its lack of random elements.
It ultimately is a game of negotiation and skill. It is this challenge of trying to code "skill" is what attracted me to this project.

For the implementation of this project, I chose to use object oriented design, since inheritance particularly lends well to the kinds of place that occur on a typical board and the varying yet similar properties of those places.
Once this project is complete, I will include a simplified UML Class diagram of the model package to showcase the OO Design.
I have also included many JUnit tests in tests package to ensure the quality of this product.
