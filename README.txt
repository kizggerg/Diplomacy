Diplomacy: The Board Game.
Implemented by Gregory Gzik

Diplomacy is perhaps one of my favourite board games of all time. It is set just before the period of WWI, and the
player is one of the great powers set to gain control of Europe. The central feature to this board game - often setting
it apart from war board games of similar style - is its lack of random elements. It ultimately is a game of negotiation
and skill. It is this challenge of trying to code "skill" is what attracted me to this project.
